# Codex Run 1

## Summary
- Implemented orchestrator CLI skeletons with config loading, runtime engine scaffolding, and artifact manager.
- Added JSON-RPC stdio desktop client with ping/capabilities support plus unit tests.
- Added desktop runner JSON-RPC server skeleton with system.ping, system.getCapabilities, and window.focus plus tests.
- Updated architecture docs and added Windows test script.

## How to Test Locally on Windows
- `scripts\\test.ps1`

## Manual Verification Steps
- Run `node orchestrator/src/cli/run.ts --workflow <path> --inputs <path> --out <dir>` after building/transpiling, and confirm it spawns the desktop runner and receives a system.ping response.

## Known Issues / Follow-ups
- Runtime engine still uses TODO driver adapters and does not execute real step actions yet.
