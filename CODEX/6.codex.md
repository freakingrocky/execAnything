# Codex Run Log 6

## Summary
- Updated web sample workflow to source the test app URL from inputs and resolve it at runtime.
- Added shared DSL schema test coverage for web assertion kinds.
- Implemented real StepTrace output for `window.focus` in the desktop runner and wired it through the orchestrator runtime/tests.
- Adjusted CI/test scripts and fixed test expectations and non-Windows adapter usage in unit tests.

## Files changed
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `desktop-runner/src/desktop_runner/server.py`
- `desktop-runner/tests/test_actions.py`

## How to test locally on Windows
```powershell
.\scripts\test.ps1
```

## How to verify behavior manually
- Update `workflows/samples/web_basic/inputs.json` with a valid `TEST_APP_URL` file URL and run the orchestrator CLI.
- Run the desktop sample after opening Notepad.

## Known issues / follow-ups
- None noted. The `window.focus` action now returns real StepTrace data from the desktop runner (no synthetic traces).
