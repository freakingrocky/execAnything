# Codex Run Log 8

## Summary
- Fixed orchestrator runtime type narrowing for desktop/web scopes, ladders, and assertions to resolve TypeScript errors.
- Added explicit validation for mixed ladders/assertions to prevent silent misrouting.

## Files changed
- `orchestrator/src/runtime/engine.ts`

## How to test locally on Windows
```powershell
cd orchestrator
npm test
```

## How to verify behavior manually
- Run a web workflow and a desktop workflow to confirm the correct selector ladders are enforced per driver.

## Known issues / follow-ups
- `npm test` in `orchestrator` fails to resolve `@ai-rpa/web-runner` in this environment (module resolution issue).
